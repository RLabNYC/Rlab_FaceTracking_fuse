## Description
Now with ARKit and an iPhone with a front-facing True Depth camera you can track your facial features allowing you animate digital avatars. The avatars first have to be prepared with point-level animation called blendshapes.  ARKit uses 52 of these to animate the avatar faces.  3D modelling is a craft that takes a long time to master and setting up all of these blendshapes can be daunting, so we’ve developed a workflow to ease the barrier to get your character up and running in a matter of minutes by levering two free avatar creation tools: Adobe Fuse and MakeHuman. Both programs have more than enough blendshapes to animate a face, the just need to be renamed to the ARKit conventions. We’ve developed a simple script to automate of lot of this process.

### Software needed: 
* Fuse downloaded from here: https://www.adobe.com/products/fuse.html
* Need to create a mixamo account (Its free!): https://www.mixamo.com/#/
* MakeHuman downloaded here: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/
* Maya student version download here: https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/maya
* Unreal downloaded here: https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/get-now/agnostic
* Python download here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ **scroll all the way to see how to download properly!
* For motion capture: 
* Motive software and you need to have a space to do mocap. 
### Software versions:
* Unreal version 4.23
* iPhone/iOS device at OS version 13.3 
* Maya 2018 or 2019
* Blender 2.82
* Python 3.8  

This tutorial requires some knowledge of using 3D software and game engine mechanics. We will provide more links for beginners that walk you through a more in depth walkthrough. 

This document will be divided up into sections and address the workflow for converting characters for Face Tracking in both MakeHuman and Fuse in parallel.
