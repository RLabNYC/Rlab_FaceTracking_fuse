# Importing and Exporting free 3D characters blendshapes with Maya

### For experienced individuals only!
If you are an already experienced in facial tracking, you can download this repo and it will be ready to work with the livelink app already!

# For Beginners
 - This repo is mainly for beginners who want to get into facetracking for personal projects, virtual production or just for fun. Please keep in mind that this repo is for the Unreal engine. 

 - First, you need to have the LiveLink app downloaded onto your iPhone before you start this tutorial. Then download or clone this repository somewhere on your computer. There are multiple ways to have a fully rigged character and have a facial rig set up in minutes. 

# Setting up with Fuse

**1. Exporting blendshapes from Fuse and importing into Maya**
   - **Adobe Fuse to Mixamo:**
   - Once you have downloaded Fuse, go through the process of creating your custom character. Make your character look however you want. Keep the model simple and avoid facial hair or eyelashes. Once you are at the last step, Fuse has a button at the top of the screen to bring your character into Mixamo. Click on “send to mixamo”.

   - After you click on "send to mixamo", your internet browser will open up and Mixamo will open automatically. Once mixamo’s algorithm is finished rigging your character, you will see two dropdown selections on the bottom of the screen.

# Exporting the blendshapes

   - **For the dropdowns:**
     - Make sure facial blendshapes are enabled.
     - Skeleton LOD 65 is fine for basic movement. 
     - Hit update rig button and you're free to download your character to your computer! 

Download your character as FBX. It should already be rigged and in a T-Pose.
   

## Exporting and setting up our python script in Maya will be the next steps!
